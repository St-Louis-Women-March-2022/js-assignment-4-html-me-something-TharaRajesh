The state is the home of the Tamil people, whose Tamil languageâ€”one of the longest surviving classical languages in the world. This is my birth place and my mother tongue is Tamil.

      <p id = "testP" class="funParagraph">My next Favourite place is Kerala in India, so far I have been there 4 times in my life, but especially in the year 2010.That was my memorable trip. Houseboat in Alleppey was fabulous, Beautiful houseboat with all amenities. The boat takes through the entire lake for almost a 2 hour cruise journey and then in the evening it settles down near the shore, It is beautiful experience to spend the entire night on the houseboat, overall a must and different experience from the Kerala trip.</p>
