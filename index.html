      <h2>TamilNadu-India:&nbsp;</h2>
      <p>Tamil Nadu is a state in southern India. Its capital and largest city is Chennai. The state is the home of the Tamil people, whose Tamil languageâ€”one of the longest surviving classical languages in the world. This is my birth place and my mother tongue is Tamil. Tamil Nadu is famous for its temples, festivals, and celebration of the arts. The Hindu temples and monuments at Mamallapuram have become famous tourist attractions.

      <h2>Mumbai-India: &nbsp;</h2>
      <p>Mumbai, previously known as Bombay is one of the most populous and biggest cities of Maharashtra state. Also the biggest metropolis of this state, Mumbai is also popular as the entertainment and financial capital. I have visited Mumbai in the year of 2015, when we went to visit my aunty house in pune, so we got chance to visit Mumbai many places, one of my favourite place is The Gateway of India. The building stands beautifully overlooking the Arabian Sea and the location of this building is what makes it so attractive.</p>

      <a name = Kerala-India></a>
      <h2>Kerala-India:&nbsp;</h2>
      <p>My next Favourite place is Kerala in India, so far I have been there 4 times in my life, but especially in the year 2010.That was my memorable trip. Houseboat in Alleppey was fabulous, Beautiful houseboat with all amenities. The boat takes through the entire lake for almost a 2 hour cruise journey and then in the evening it settles down near the shore, It is beautiful experience to spend the entire night on the houseboat, overall a must and different experience from the Kerala trip.</p>

      <h2>Zoo-Singapore:&nbsp;</h2>
      <p>Singapore Zoo is one of the best zoos I have visited so far. Despite being in a city, it feels like you are in the middle of the jungle, with the lush rainforest. This place I have visited in the year 2014 with my sister family and my mother. It was a nice and memorable trip. I enjoyed this place with my Daughter. I love to visit again with my family.</p>

      <h2>Susono-Japan:&nbsp;</h2>
      <p>Japan is a wonderful country and one of the most practical countries in which you can live. we lived here for one year, It was an amazing experience with different culture and learned many things. Japan is wonderful because its public transports are not only just very efficient, but also extremely punctual. My favourite place in japan is Mount Fuji. Mt. Fuji is the tallest peak in Japan.</p>
